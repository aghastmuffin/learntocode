    <h1>Variables and Data Assignments!</h1>
    <p class="rinfo">running V3</p>
    <p>That sounds pretty complicated, but don't worry about it! Together, we'll break this lesson down into byte sized pieces (haha)</p>
    <h2>What is a Variable?</h2>
    <p>Think of a variable as a box where you can store things. Imagine you have a bunch of different colored marbles, and you want to keep them organized. You can use different boxes to store different colors. In programming, variables are these "boxes" that store different types of data.    </p>
    <h3>Creating a Variable</h3>
    <p>In Python, creating a variable is as easy as naming it and giving it a value. Here's how you do it  (you can change box to whatever, it is just a placeholder, as well as the value it holds, this is just an example):</p>
    <pre><code id="code" contenteditable="false" class="language-python">box = 10</code></pre>
    <p>Now, if you've ever coded before in a statically typed language, this might be confusing. Why don't I have to specify what type of variable box is? (int, str, float) Python is a dynamically typed language, and therefore the variable assignment is given at runtime, line by line.</p>
    <p>this part of what makes python special. But this still doesn't mean Python is a magician, it can't determine what you want from thin air. that's where datatypes come in.</p>
    <h3>string</h3>
    <p>a string in python, or a str, is a piece of text inside that box. It can hold any data. It is shown with either a single quote ' to start and a ' to end, or a double quote so: </p>
   <pre><code id="code" contenteditable="false" class="language-python">box = "I am 1 box, I hold data!"
   #or
   box = 'I am 1 box, I hold data!'</code></pre>
    <p>Now if you notice, the variable holds numbers, letters, AND symbols! That's sick!</p>
    <h3>Integer</h3>
    <p>an integer is a type of variable that can only hold... guess... Integers. Now if you're a math nerd you know that an integer is a number, but not just any number, it has to be a whole number</p>
    <pre><code id="code" contenteditable="false" class="language-python">box = 10</code></pre>
    <p>integer variables can only hold integers. Trying to give them a string will break them. They also do not use quotes.</p>
    <h3> Booleen </h3>
    <p> a Booleen is like a light switch, it can be on or off. It is useful for evaluating a statement's validity, and holding that answer. It uses True, or False (case sensitive) an example of a booleen is: </p>
     <pre><code id="code" contenteditable="false" class="language-python">box = True 
         box = False</code></pre>
    <p>There are many more uses for variables in python, and while I wont tell all of them in this lesson here are a few that you will learn. print(variable) will print the contents of the variable. if variable == True/False/Any_data: will check if the variable equals some data, and execute any code inside the if statement if true, or skip if false.</p>
    <p> that's it for now! I hope you enjoyed. Variables are a key part of a program, becuase they can be changed multiple times! and used to store data that can be used later.</p>
